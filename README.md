## üåê API Integration

The Weather App integrates with the **[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)** to retrieve real-time weather conditions and 5-day forecasts based on the user‚Äôs selected city.

### üîë API Key Setup

To access OpenWeatherMap services, you'll need to obtain a free API key:

1. Sign up at [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/).
2. Navigate to your account > API keys.
3. Create a new key or use the default one provided.

Add your API key to a local environment variable file:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Never expose your API key directly in the code. Use environment variables (`.env.local`) and the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for secure client-side access in Next.js.

---

### üì° Endpoints Used

The app makes use of the following OpenWeatherMap endpoints:

- Current Weather Data

  ```
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric
  ```

- 5-Day / 3-Hour Forecast

  ```
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric
  ```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Fetching

Weather data is fetched using native `fetch()` calls inside React components. Example:

```ts
const fetchWeatherData = async (city: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY}&units=metric`
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
```

- ‚úÖ Error handling included for invalid city input
- üîÅ Refresh button re-fetches latest data on demand
- üîç Search dynamically queries data using city name

---

### üíæ Caching & State

- Uses `LocalStorage` to persist recent search history for quick access
- Optionally, you can enhance with tools like `SWR` or `React Query` for advanced caching and revalidation

## üß© Folder Structure


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
